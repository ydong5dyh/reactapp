I made a website for a milk tea shop. Customers can use the website to find the food
and drinks they want to order and place them in the cart.
There are 3 main parts of the interface.
1. A top panel that contains all the filtering and sorting functionalities. Customers
can filter by product type (milk tea/fruit tea/other) and tea type (what type of
tea is in the product: black/green/other). They can also sort products by price.
2. A list that displays all products that satisfy filters with customer's sorting
preference. Here, customers can click buttons to add products to cart.
3. A cart showing all products customers added, as well as a total price. Customers
can remove products here.

I have 3 main js file.
In App.js, I initialize a FilteredList component.
In DisplayList.js, I use a map function to display each product with their
corresponding information (image, text description,...)
In FilteredList.js, I handle filtering and sorting with different functions. And
I return the products that satisfy customers' requests. My filter and sort UI
components are also written here along with the functions that they trigger. My
cart is also in this js file, I use the state to record the items in cart and update
the list accordingly whenever customers add/remove an item. I also use the cart
in state to calculate total price (my aggregated field).
